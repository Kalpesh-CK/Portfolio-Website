* CSS Frameworks Used:
----------------------
1) Tailwind CSS: Provides utility-based CSS classes for styling the layout and design.

2) Font Awesome: Provides icons for social media links, project icons, and contact methods.



* Responsive Design:
--------------------
1) The website is built with responsiveness in mind using Tailwind CSS classes for different screen sizes.
 ,( For desktop/laptop ) ,( For iPad Mini ) ,( For Samsung Galaxy S8+ this incomplete because of time limit ) 
,

2) On larger screens, the navigation bar displays horizontally, while on smaller screens (mobile view), it transforms into a hamburger menu.



* Interactivity and Behavior:
-----------------------------
1) Checkboxes for Certifications: When a user clicks on the certification labels, they will reveal the respective certification images (using checkboxes and labels).

2) Read More Button in About Section: A checkbox is used to toggle the visibility of additional information in the About section.

3) Hover Effects: Project images show hidden descriptions when hovered over.

4) skills section add some line hover when user hover on it then line how 50% fill 

5) home section profile image border animation.

6) about section image animation. 

7) responsive design header dropdown hover effect



* Possible Improvements:
------------------------
1) Day/Night Toggle: The current day/night toggle is a placeholder. Implementing toggle the theme between dark and light mode can improve user experience ( righ now not create because of time limit of submission).

2) Form Submission: The contact form does not currently submit data. Implementing backend functionality (e.g., using a form handling service or backend framework) will make this functional.




* Challenges Faced:
-------------------

1) Tailwind CSS Responsiveness:

I faced issues with certain elements not adjusting properly across different screen sizes. Despite using Tailwind's responsive classes (like sm:, md:, lg:), some components didn’t align as expected, especially on smaller devices.


2) Responsive Header Hover Effects:

The hover effects on the header menu were not functioning as expected on smaller screens. On mobile devices, the hover effects didn't trigger, and the header was not fully responsive in terms of interactions.

3) Project Hover Effects:

The hover effects on project cards (showing descriptions) weren’t consistent. Some descriptions didn’t appear on hover, and the transition time felt delayed.
